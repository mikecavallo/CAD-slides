# Calling All Dogs course videos: handoff notes

Read this first in any new session. The project lives in `reactivity-part1/` (see its README for the build
pipeline). This file records the state, decisions and working agreements from earlier sessions.

## The project

- Trainer and narrator: **Tori Ganino, BS, CDBC, CPDT-KA**, Calling All Dogs (callingalldogsny.com).
  Refer to Tori by name; pronouns were never stated, so do not assume any.
- Presentation: **"Getting Started with Dog Behavior: Understanding Reactivity and Aggression"**, a narrated,
  animated slide video (HTML + GSAP scenes rendered to MP4, synced to Tori's recorded voice).
- Script source of truth: Tori's Google Doc "Reactivity & Aggression Part 1: Script v4 (one chapter)",
  id `13FHWVCWAWskM90w2_UFwAlC1o68YjxhpX_XuGuxaYDE` (read it with the Google Drive connector; Claude cannot
  edit it, so give Tori paste-ready text). Everything above "END OF FIRST CHAPTER MATERIAL" is done. The
  material below that line (ABCs, function, four directions, leash walk before/during/after training, warning
  signals, start your list) is the draft for **Chapter 2 onward**. Sync `script/lesson.json` to the doc before
  every build; the doc wins.

## Current structure (Chapter 1 is finished, pending Tori's later edits)

- `ch00` Welcome: `ch00s01` title slide (headshot, training photo, name and credentials).
- `ch01` "Starting with the Basics": the chapter card plays first, then `ch00s02` the plan slide (id kept so
  its recording still matches; cards: Why you're here / What you'll gain / How we'll get there; steps:
  "The difference between reactivity and aggression", "The ingredients that shape behavior"), then
  `ch01s01` to `ch01s12` (definitions, look beyond the label, why, the eight bowl ingredients, putting it
  together). Last slide ends on a barking dog circled by three "?" badges in a cycle (teases the ABCs).
- Scene code: `video/scenes/c0.js` (ch00s01, ch00s02), `c1a.js` to `c1e.js` (chapter 1), shared bowl module
  `c1_bowl.js`. Older versions are in `video/scenes/archive/` and `script/archive/`.

## Recordings (Tori's voice)

- One file per slide, named by scene id: `Ch01s05.m4a` (case does not matter). A slide in pieces:
  `Ch01s07_part_1`, `Ch01s07_part_2`. Files go in `reactivity-part1/narration/`.
- `narration/` is gitignored (the repo is public), so **recordings are not in GitHub**. In a new session, ask
  Tori to re-upload the takes for any slide being rebuilt with voice.
- Build with voice: `python3 tools/align.py && python3 tools/timing.py --mode narration && node tools/render.mjs
  --workers 3 && python3 tools/assemble.py --name Getting-Started-with-Dog-Behavior`.
  align.py levels each take, trims lead-in/tail noise and slates (voiced-sound based), and cuts slides exactly
  between takes. Partly recorded chapters build a video of just the recorded slides.
- Preview without voice: `tools/tts_scratch.py`, `tools/scratch_narration.py`, then `align.py --dir
  build/scratch_narration`, `timing.py --mode narration`, render, `assemble.py --silent`.
- When the recording differs from the script, check the doc; usually Tori changed the wording on purpose.
  Update lesson.json and any cue phrases (`sayAt(ctx, beat, 'phrase')`) that no longer match.

## Delivery

- Send a compressed copy through chat (CRF 26, about 28 MB; the chat upload limit is under 88 MB).
- Online pages (republish the same file path to keep the URL): narrated video
  https://claude.ai/artifact/Q4WnoBBniuysUrV4ssy7hT (`out/web/chapter1-narrated/`), visuals-only preview
  https://claude.ai/artifact/GCofjK4PiTMr3arKJFSUKz (`out/web/chapter1/`). Built with `tools/web_parts.py` and
  `tools/web_page.py` (see README).
- YouTube: Tori uploads there. For crisp text, upload a true 4K render: `node tools/render.mjs --scale 2`
  then `python3 tools/assemble.py --segments segments@2x --no-chapters`. Too big for chat; agree a delivery
  route first. Tori said not to make it until Chapter 1 edits are final.

## Decisions already made (do not undo without asking)

- Ingredient bowl metaphor and the eight chips; photo portraits for genetics (barking Sheltie = more
  sensitive, scruffy white dog = more easygoing); "Before birth" uses a sprout icon.
- Breed slide: six job cards (Herding: Aussie, Guarding: Great Pyrenees, Hunting: Beagle, Terrier: Jack
  Russell, Sporting: Golden Retriever, Working and assistance: black Lab), each enlarges with a small vignette;
  silhouettes row is cut from real photos and the logo (`assets/img/sil_*.png`).
- "Same behavior, different reasons" on the barking slide.
- On-screen text never uses em or en dashes.

## Working with Tori

- Direct and short. No filler, no em dashes, no step-by-step narration of what you are doing. Give a
  recommendation, not a menu. Do anything you can do yourself instead of asking Tori to.
- After each build: send the video file, update the online page, say what changed in a few lines, and give
  timestamps.
- Images attached in a message sent while you are mid-task are not saved to disk; ask Tori to resend them in a
  new message.

## Gotchas

- Image changes do not invalidate the render cache: re-render the affected scenes with `--only ID --force`.
- After changing the hash rules in render.mjs, run `node tools/render.mjs --rehash` before re-timing.
- Never stop processes with `pkill -f` on a pattern that matches your own shell; loop over /proc instead.
- Photo sites (pexels, unsplash, wikimedia) are blocked by the network policy; npm, pip and GitHub release
  downloads work.
